## Workflow Orchestration Rules

### 1. Plan Mode Default

- Enter plan mode for any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, stop and re-plan immediately; do not keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After any correction from the user, update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Iterate on these lessons until the mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant projects

### 4. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, and demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes, pause and ask: "Is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky, use: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes; do not over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When given a bug report, fix it without hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, or failing tests, then resolve them
- Require zero context switching from the user
- Fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management Rules

1. **Plan First**: Write a plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plans**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: Provide a high-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add a review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what is necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
